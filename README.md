# nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare

itt i try and make a ps2 game without knowing what i'm doing :D

note: you will need [ps2dev/ps2dev](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev) to compile this, last i checked it kinda crashes halfway through the `ports` compilation, when it does, just run `./build-extras.sh`
